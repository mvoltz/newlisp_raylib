My heavy hammer approach:
- do while not dead
   - learn programming, newlisp and raylib simultaneously, because why not
   - copy/paste the excellent raylib cheatsheet
   - import functions without getting clever  
   - troubleshoot the squirrely sh**
   - curse to self
   - put away

Make no mistake, this code does not work yet.  It may never work, but hopefully that's not the case.
